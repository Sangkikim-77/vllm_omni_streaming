*Latest News* 🔥

- [2025/11] vLLM community officially released [vllm-project/vllm-omni](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni) in order to support omni-modality models serving.

---

## About

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) was originally designed to support large language models for text-based autoregressive generation tasks. vLLM-Omni is a framework that extends its support for omni-modality model inference and serving:

- **Omni-modality**: Text, image, video, and audio data processing
- **Non-autoregressive Architectures**: extend the AR support of vLLM to Diffusion Transformers (DiT) and other parallel generation models
- **Heterogeneous outputs**: from traditional text generation to multimodal outputs

</p>

vLLM-Omni is fast with:

- State-of-the-art AR support by leveraging efficient KV cache management from vLLM
- Pipelined stage execution overlapping for high throughput performance
- Fully disaggregation based on OmniConnector and dynamic resource allocation across stages

vLLM-Omni is flexible and easy to use with:

- Heterogeneous pipeline abstraction to manage complex model workflows
- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- Tensor, pipeline, data and expert parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server

vLLM-Omni seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:

- Omni-modality models (e.g. Qwen-Omni)
- Multi-modality generation models (e.g. Qwen-Image)

## Getting Started

Visit our [documentation](https://vllm-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more.

- [Installation](https://vllm-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation/)
- [Quickstart](https://vllm-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart/)
- [List of Supported Models](https://vllm-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models/)

## Quick Start - Sample Web Client

This repository includes a sample HTTPS web client for real-time audio streaming.

### Prerequisites

Generate SSL certificates (required for HTTPS WebSocket connections):

```bash
mkdir -p certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

You can press Enter for all prompts to use default values.

### Running the Sample Client

```bash
cd sample
python run_https.py
```

Then open your browser to `https://localhost:9101`

### Configuration

The sample client uses configuration files:

- **`config.yaml`**: Default configuration (committed to repo)
  - Server settings (host, port, certificate paths)
  - WebSocket connection URL
  - Audio processing parameters

- **`config.local.yaml`**: Local overrides (git-ignored)
  - Copy from `config.local.yaml.example` and customize
  - Use this to override server IP for remote connections

Example `config.local.yaml`:
```yaml
websocket:
  url: "wss://your-server-ip:9102/ws/audio"

server:
  port: 9101
```

For the web client (JavaScript), use `config.local.json` instead:
```json
{
  "websocket": {
    "url": "wss://your-server-ip:9102/ws/audio"
  }
}
```
